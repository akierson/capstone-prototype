23 year ov long journey
Among the living dead
On nonsense nourish'd I
My naked soul and where am i?
In the palace ov the underworld
Without enemy nor friend
Pay I for fathers legacy
Half-man, half-beast
DEMIGOD

And my hunger was never fed
My desires never fulfilled
But my wish to become
The one with universe
Has always entangled me
And forsaken I shall not be
Though my flesh is torn apart
Though my heart seems dead and cold
My will transgress
The spirit lives on!Was it tomorrow
Or will it be yesterday
When abolished, rotten instincts
Will, for the last time, be awake
And malice, slander, and hate
Will rule the ignorant heart

But the trail leads toward greed

How many, all of them?

Created through pale ages

Sealed ye gates ov your own paradise

Thee who spits out sun
From thy mouth
In endless momentum -
Kamala's menstruum
On road to immortality
We go against current
To the womb ov Kali
Through the mouth ov Bhairavi
To the final dawn ov Chaos
How come we're still alive?
In these kingdoms ov filth
When heaven's so abstract
And hell is so real...

[Lead: Nergal]I've seen strange signs on my way
Silent shadows
Dancing shapes
And angels fallen on the earth

Face up
And look here
When the root ov thy cannot reach

Art thou Nephilim child?
Are ye looking for thy Elysium?
Here among the living trees?
Among the fading stars, varibility ov forms?

Sometimes love, sometimes sadness ov things
Sometimes rapture, and wine o sabbath
Sometimes hatred, divine rage
And 93 rears,no limit ,beyond the sin-gilgolem

Ye taught me the secret words:
IOA SABAO
Protect thy Daimon

Why, why whisper thoughts
But might is raised
When conjurer of seasons
Hums the song....sorrowful ,joyful
Night is eternal
And day is eternal
With runes ov life
And runes ov death
As above, so below
Now it's time ov the BeastO, Serpent and Lion!
I invoke Thee!
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside!
Outside desert ov restriction
In act ov rebellion
On the sea ov motion
Stability ov matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant ov every breath

In serpentine dance ov blood cells
In simplicity ov spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet Thy presence

Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above:
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please

Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!

Arise! my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels ov almighty god-
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot ov the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god

Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life

And by thy master, Graphiel
Come unto me
O Bartzabel!Before the beginning of years
There came to the making of man
Time, with a gift of tears
Grief, with a glass that ran
Pleasure, with pain for leaven
Summer, with flowers that fell
Remembrance fallen from heaven
And madness risen from hell
Strength without hands to smite
Love that endures for a breath
Night the shadow of light
And life the shadow of death
And the high gods took in hand
Fire and the falling of tears
And a measure of sliding sand
From under the feet of the years
And froth and drift of the sea
And dust of the laboring earth
And bodies of things to be
In the houses of death and of birth
And wrought with weeping and laughter
And fashioned with loathing and love
With life before and after
And death beneath and aboveThee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Hearken hosts on high
Fetch me your god
As my ambition prescribes
Challenge the sun

Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount of congregation
Far toward the north

Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Hearken dogs ov Nazarene
Linger at St. Peter’s door
Partake from the well ov nothingness
Bite the withered hand ov god

Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north

Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Boreal hell beneath my feet
Blistering Eden above
With prayer on lips
With freedom bequeathed
Through fire we walk
With fire in hearts[Background Lead: Nergal]

Behold the throne ov burning gold
And all the evil that it shelters
Yet I be monarch myself
Offering more than others give

Materialize the ashes ov Elysium burned
Not even angels dare to bid farewell
Annihilate this Eden now
Blasphemy gives birth to divine

Feed my flame!

Rape these wounds!
Asmodeus
Raise me high!
Belial
Through Thy rage my will manifests

[Lead: Seth]
[Lead: Nergal]

I truly am my own redeemer
Blindly I follow none but myself
Without fear I am
Unhallowed be my name

Myself am hell and hell I shall unleash
I laugh at Thee to scorn
Mock Thy majesty
Pour forth my chalice ov victory

Hear my call!
Leviathan
Bless my path!

Belial
Through Thy wrath my will manifestsFrom beyond all paths ov man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark! For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked, yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men

Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the "I"

I didst create demigods, strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths ov mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh, I shall feast in Gutter, as king ov nothing
I shall feed on thee, the Mightiest One
Behold! For I am Him!
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn

Hear...
Feel...
Pray...
Kneel...

No holiness rules over my freedom
No commands from above I obey
I seek the ruin, I shake the worlds
Behold! I am blackest ov the black

Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the "I"Flames reflect in my eyes
The wildness and hate are born
I draw the magic signs in the air
The pride, act of holy bastards burnt
Here's no more place for them
There's no day, only the moon and the night

I turn into ashes all the holiness
I destroy the altars of contempt with my sword
Then I hide in a blackrain, naked trees
The depths of the forests are my home
As the wolf I appear this night
As the wild dog I'm howling with lust for blood and hunger

I'm the warrior of the night obsessed by hell
Bringing hate, pain and desire
I observe the blackwitches of beauty
Protected with the shadow of my sword
They gave me the wisdom, fed with blasphemy
They assist in my every journey, my heart belongs to them

At midnight I call the winds of mayhem
The power of the horned evil protects me
I see how Jesus' tears mix with angel's blood
In my visions I observe...
How the skies turn to black, with the upcoming fire

I'm playing with the view of this night
I love the gloomy landscapes of my world
Obsessed like an animal, old as the planet
I speak words of the ancient knowledge
I give you things, which in paradise
Could be only a dream...I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve, dissolved by flame
Looked down on Son ov God, snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread, and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return (Hail! Hail! Hail!)

Hosanna! (hosanna)
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna! (hosanna)
Root ov David eradicate

Hosanna! (hosanna)
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna! (hosanna)
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our heartsWitchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain
Kill

Witchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain
Kill

Winds of war, winds of hate
Armageddon, tales from Hell
The wage of mayhem, the wage of sin
Come and hear, Lucifer sings

Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood
Command for Satan
Command for youAvatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess - my eternal mistress
I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I - her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One

I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress - it is real!

Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red - hot firmament (of golden darkenings of heavens)
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
'Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now, here and nowFly high my black eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite
On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond the reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Circle round and round, my black eagle
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all-devouring

Slash with your beak
Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! The whole cosmos tremble
May echoes become my sweetest mantra
Spirit of freedom! Eternal wanderer! Joyful solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one
When I am you and you are meFly, fly high my Black Eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite
On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond The Reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth to the halves
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Circle! Round and round my Black Eagle
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all - devouring
Slash! Slash with your beak
Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! Let the whole cosmos tremble
May echoes become my the sweetest mantra
Spirit of Freedom! Eternal Wanderer! Joyfull Solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of Awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one
I'm you and you are meIn the forests of eternal dreaming
Old oaks lighted up by the fullmoon's light
The coldness of dungeon touches the inside of wooden maze
From the womb of the mother-wolf I was born
The witches foretold in the hearts of my enemies
In the midnight wilderness I took a pledge
Quickly I fell in love with the taste of steel
For ages waiting for it's denudation
The final triumph
The pure barbarity

I howl to the moon for support in my battle
The moon, symbol of purity, the essence of beauty
I damn the sun, rising again and again
In brightness of bloody light, steel holocaust
I received hails from the northern side
Of snowcovered Carpathians
The light breath of nightmare, as a sign
I summon the iron powers, cavalry of my brothers
From the land of armageddish fields

I am the bard of eastern lands...

I lead my brothers for death struggle
In glory of victory my armies rise
Barbarian tribes with fury of destruction
With axes reach the sky, hiding usurpator in their wings
Call the clouds, desecrating all the holiness
Hurt bodies on the snow, Pandemonium burns
This battle is a rebellion, rebirth of old traditions
Mythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors
There they attain eternity and sit high on the throne

Pagan nations became united
Mighty bards received their long awaited silence
Slavs returned to their villages and woods
Pagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled
... I opened the door to the higher than stars knowledge
And took a long walk throughout the unknown dimensions
As the sign of fullmoon, in damnation I shall rise[Verse 1]
Reptile!
Spreading sickness and disease among the men
Grubby creed!
What are ye but the soulless meat?
Lunatic!
Cancer consuming Thy race from inside
Beware!
No grace awaits Thee in the crying skies above

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's work

[Verse 2]
Vultures attack!
May hell unlock overpowering might
Mourn not, my comrades!
Thou art fateless in the blinding light
Soldiers!
On the altar ov liberation crucify the whore
Rejoice!
Drink to crucifixion
For oppression is no more!

[Bridge]
Slay the whore!
Make it bleed
Make it weep
Let it die forever more
Slit the throat!
Let them rot
Let them pay
Let em taste their own blood
Make em crawl!
Upon this corpse
I shall feast
'Till no hope remains for the twisted mob!

[Verse 3]
Mithras!
Raise Thy sword of judgment, loose the iron rain
Beat the drum
No earthly power
May hinder nor stop Thee
Sekhmet!
Manifestation ov Mut
Protector ov Ma'at
I call upon the most divine
To spew forth this infecting dust ov life

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's workBehold bastard son
I am the evil one
No glory to be reached
No more thy slavery
The passion I besieged
Spawn terror
Smash thy will
Ye pale dominion fades away
My will dominates

And watch my star arise
Burning up the earth
Sun - the eye of gods
Threw into the space
Watch ye moon eclipse
Falling from thy grace
Watch all nations cry
All feared ov his name
Praise the flame!
Watch angels falling from the skies
Praise the flame! praise the flame!
I killed thy god
My will is done!
Thou art lord

Rise me! rise me high!
Lead thru the gates ov sun
Rise me! rise me high!
Where angels do not dare to fly
Invite to feast ov gods
And let me drift away
Leave flames ov infamy
And watch me kiss the stars23 year ov long journey

That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god

Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life

And by thy master, Graphiel
Come unto me
O Bartzabel!Before the beginning of years
There came to the making of man
Time, with a gift of tears
Grief, with a glass that ran
Pleasure, with pain for leaven
Summer, with flowers that fell
Remembrance fallen from heaven
And madness risen from hell
Strength without hands to smite
Love that endures for a breath
Night the shadow of light
And life the shadow of death
And the high gods took in hand
Fire and the falling of tears
And a measure of sliding sand
From under the feet of the years
And froth and drift of the sea
And dust of the laboring earth
And bodies of things to be
In the houses of death and of birth
And wrought with weeping and laughter
And fashioned with loathing and love
With life before and after
And death beneath and aboveThee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Hearken hosts on high
Fetch me your god
As my ambition prescribes
Challenge the sun

Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount of congregation
Far toward the north

Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Hearken dogs ov Nazarene
Linger at St. Peter’s door
Partake from the well ov nothingness
Bite the withered hand ov god

Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north

Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Boreal hell beneath my feet
Blistering Eden above
With prayer on lips
With freedom bequeathed
Through fire we walk
With fire in hearts[Background Lead: Nergal]

Behold the throne ov burning gold
And all the evil that it shelters
Yet I be monarch myself
Offering more than others give

Materialize the ashes ov Elysium burned
Not even angels dare to bid farewell
Annihilate this Eden now
Blasphemy gives birth to divine

Feed my flame!
Leviathan
Rape these wounds!
Asmodeus
Raise me high!
Belial
Through Thy rage my will manifests

[Lead: Seth]
[Lead: Nergal]

I truly am my own redeemer
Blindly I follow none but myself
Without fear I am
Unhallowed be my name

Myself am hell and hell I shall unleash
I laugh at Thee to scorn
Mock Thy majesty
Pour forth my chalice ov victory

Hear my call!
Leviathan
Bless my path!
Amodeus
Lift me up!
Belial
Through Thy wrath my will manifests

Amodeus
Lift me up!
Belial
Through Thy wrath my will manifestsFrom beyond all paths ov man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark! For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked, yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men

Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the "I"

I didst create demigods, strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths ov mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh, I shall feast in Gutter, as king ov nothing
I shall feed on thee, the Mightiest One
Behold! For I am Him!
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn

Hear...
Feel...
Pray...
Kneel...

No holiness rules over my freedom
No commands from above I obey
I seek the ruin, I shake the worlds
Behold! I am blackest ov the black

Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the "I"Flames reflect in my eyes
The wildness and hate are born
I draw the magic signs in the air
The pride, act of holy bastards burnt
Here's no more place for them
There's no day, only the moon and the night

I turn into ashes all the holiness
I destroy the altars of contempt with my sword
Then I hide in a blackrain, naked trees
The depths of the forests are my home
As the wolf I appear this night
As the wild dog I'm howling with lust for blood and hunger

I'm the warrior of the night obsessed by hell
Bringing hate, pain and desire
I observe the blackwitches of beauty
Protected with the shadow of my sword
They gave me the wisdom, fed with blasphemy
They assist in my every journey, my heart belongs to them

At midnight I call the winds of mayhem
The power of the horned evil protects me
I see how Jesus' tears mix with angel's blood
In my visions I observe...
How the skies turn to black, with the upcoming fire

I'm playing with the view of this night
I love the gloomy landscapes of my world
Obsessed like an animal, old as the planet
I speak words of the ancient knowledge
I give you things, which in paradise
Could be only a dream...I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve, dissolved by flame
Looked down on Son ov God, snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread, and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return (Hail! Hail! Hail!)

Hosanna! (hosanna)
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna! (hosanna)
Root ov David eradicate

Hosanna! (hosanna)
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna! (hosanna)
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our heartsWitchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain
Kill

Witchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain
Kill

Winds of war, winds of hate
Armageddon, tales from Hell
The wage of mayhem, the wage of sin
Come and hear, Lucifer sings

Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood
Command for Satan
Command for youAvatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess - my eternal mistress
I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I - her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One

I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress - it is real!

Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red - hot firmament (of golden darkenings of heavens)
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
'Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now, here and nowFly high my black eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite
On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond the reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Circle round and round, my black eagle
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all-devouring

Slash with your beak
Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! The whole cosmos tremble
May echoes become my sweetest mantra
Spirit of freedom! Eternal wanderer! Joyful solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one
When I am you and you are meFly, fly high my Black Eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite
On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond The Reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth to the halves
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Circle! Round and round my Black Eagle
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all - devouring
Slash! Slash with your beak
Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! Let the whole cosmos tremble
May echoes become my the sweetest mantra
Spirit of Freedom! Eternal Wanderer! Joyfull Solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of Awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one
I'm you and you are meIn the forests of eternal dreaming
Old oaks lighted up by the fullmoon's light
The coldness of dungeon touches the inside of wooden maze
From the womb of the mother-wolf I was born
The witches foretold in the hearts of my enemies
In the midnight wilderness I took a pledge
Quickly I fell in love with the taste of steel
For ages waiting for it's denudation
The final triumph
The pure barbarity

I howl to the moon for support in my battle
The moon, symbol of purity, the essence of beauty
I damn the sun, rising again and again
In brightness of bloody light, steel holocaust
I received hails from the northern side
Of snowcovered Carpathians
The light breath of nightmare, as a sign
I summon the iron powers, cavalry of my brothers
From the land of armageddish fields

I am the bard of eastern lands...

I lead my brothers for death struggle
In glory of victory my armies rise
Barbarian tribes with fury of destruction
With axes reach the sky, hiding usurpator in their wings
Call the clouds, desecrating all the holiness
Hurt bodies on the snow, Pandemonium burns
This battle is a rebellion, rebirth of old traditions
Mythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors
There they attain eternity and sit high on the throne

Pagan nations became united
Mighty bards received their long awaited silence
Slavs returned to their villages and woods
Pagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled
... I opened the door to the higher than stars knowledge
And took a long walk throughout the unknown dimensions
As the sign of fullmoon, in damnation I shall rise[Verse 1]
Reptile!
Spreading sickness and disease among the men
Grubby creed!
What are ye but the soulless meat?
Lunatic!
Cancer consuming Thy race from inside
Beware!
No grace awaits Thee in the crying skies above

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's work

[Verse 2]
Vultures attack!
May hell unlock overpowering might
Mourn not, my comrades!
Thou art fateless in the blinding light
Soldiers!
On the altar ov liberation crucify the whore
Rejoice!
Drink to crucifixion
For oppression is no more!

[Bridge]
Slay the whore!
Make it bleed
Make it weep
Let it die forever more
Slit the throat!
Let them rot
Let them pay
Let em taste their own blood
Make em crawl!
Upon this corpse
I shall feast
'Till no hope remains for the twisted mob!

[Verse 3]
Mithras!
Raise Thy sword of judgment, loose the iron rain
Beat the drum
No earthly power
May hinder nor stop Thee
Sekhmet!
Manifestation ov Mut
Protector ov Ma'at
I call upon the most divine
To spew forth this infecting dust ov life

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's workBehold bastard son
I am the evil one
No glory to be reached
No more thy slavery
The passion I besieged
Spawn terror
Smash thy will
Ye pale dominion fades away
My will dominates

And watch my star arise
Burning up the earth
Sun - the eye of gods
Threw into the space
Watch ye moon eclipse
Falling from thy grace
Watch all nations cry
All feared ov his name
Praise the flame!
Watch angels falling from the skies
Praise the flame! praise the flame!
I killed thy god
My will is done!
Thou art lord

Rise me! rise me high!
Lead thru the gates ov sun
Rise me! rise me high!
Where angels do not dare to fly
Invite to feast ov gods
And let me drift away
Leave flames ov infamy
And watch me kiss the stars
